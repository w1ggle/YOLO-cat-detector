# My-Cat-Detector
I wanted to test out computer vision and AI and learn how to train a model for a fun project for myself. I want to get this on a board (raspberry pi, but would love to get it on an FPGA. Self learning how to do that atm) to make a standalone unit as an end goal. However, there are some challenges due to this goal, but I think it will be a fun learning experience.

Looking for AI models, I got stuck between openCV and YOLO. I ended up with Yolo as it appears to be the newest thing on the market as it launched about 2 months ago. However, there is not many examples of how to use it, just the official documentation.

Atm, I have the model trained on a small data set of my cat, but I want to train it on all of them to see if it can differentiate between them
